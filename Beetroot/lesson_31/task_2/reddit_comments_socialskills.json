Apparently I was always a \u201cbear\u201d in the morning; however she stated that I was a very sweet and laid-back kid most of the time. It\u2019s just never been easy for me waking up early. Fast forward to now...my job as a teacher requires me to get up at 5:00 am, and the job is so fun, I MAKE myself do it. The kids at school seem to be struggling with the early hours, too, so I do identify with their struggles. Some of my students have jobs outside of school, and I try to find out which ones work. High school kids today are awesome. I think we will be in good hands in the future."

Sounds like you are probably in good shape physically, use that to your advantage to help with mind focus. Have a daily running/workout schedule and stick to it, schedules are super important for the hyper-mind. Next have a goal, to run a marathon or do a triathlon, knowing you have an end goal will give your energy something to focus on, and once you complete it that will help your confidence, it will be something you can put YOURSELF on a pedestal for.\nYou can also schedule to do other things that require mind/body focus and that have an end goal-martial arts, painting classes, dancing. Each accomplishment will help you build your personal pedestal more.\nAs for being needy, some of us are and it can be hard for other people and hurt relationships, that said you cannot \u201cwill it away\u201d, be honest about it with people, let them know you are working on it and acknowledge it.\nI hope that helps a little. Maybe just knowing someone read it will help.\nI wish you luck\nDon\u2019t forget to get some sleep"

This doesn\u2019t make you bad or being sensitive bad in ANY way. Being sensitive means you care. Maybe start taking time alone to cry. If you know you are going to cry excuse yourself and spend time alone. Not all the time of course, because there is nothing wrong with crying, but distancing yourself from critics when you do might make you feel better. Also, thank you for caring so much about the world."

    "27 Feb 2021, 06:33:44": "OP, what helped me most was to focus on the SUBJECT matter. It pivots the attention away from you. Conceptualize facing someone, then riding in a car with them pointing together at something else. That\u2019s it! Also: the redirect and voluntold. Pass the ball and get others involved up front to reduce the burden. Call on peers. Share the feels. This is how I handle DAILY high pressure situations that would have melted me a decade ago. It\u2019s NOT about you!"

My goal it's to keep my weight but go under 12% body fat by march 2022. What most annoy me is my social skills. That's why I posted here, cuz things I can control like working or exercise I do pretty good, but when it comes to other people like friends or girls I suck at it and it is what drains my will and energy. \n\nThanks for the advice"

I'm not a big fan of shows like Grey's Anatomy or whatever is popular right now, but I just like cartoons because if I could draw and if I could write good stories, it would look like steven universe or bee and puppycat. Plus, they're cute!! and have cute songs."

    "27 Feb 2021, 06:42:22": "Smh also so many cartoons are aimed at both younger and older audiences (SU, Gumball, Animaniacs, IZ, etc.), and the ones that are aimed at only kids are like wholesome and what's wrong with enjoying that? And there are many that are only aimed at adult audiences (Bojack, Bob's Burgers, Futurama, Disenchantment, American Dad, just to name a few). A ton of people love cartoons, it's so silly to make a blanket statement like that's immature."

These two teenage girls started making fun of me in Japanese because they didn't know that my partner fully understood them. That made me feel terrible. Just absolutely terrible and I love claw machines! Maybe I should just stop listening to judgy people!"

You deserve to enjoy these things and those people have their own issues to deal with if they get enjoyment out of disparaging something that brings another person happiness. Emotionally healthy people should be able to find happiness (or at the very least just not be affected at all) from seeing other people get pleasure out of the things they genuinely love. If your idea of a good time is mocking someone like that, seek help."

For example, if they talk about birds it would reminds me of my daughter who loves birds. I might then start talking about my daughter. To me there\u2019s a logical connection there but probably not to the outside observer.\n\nBut yeah I would somehow acknowledge their statement, talk about my daughter, then make my way back to talking about birds (the original topic). I do this without thinking and actually only recently noticed this was my pattern in conversation."
