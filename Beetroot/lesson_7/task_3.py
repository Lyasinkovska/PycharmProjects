"""
A simple calculator.

Create a function called make_operation, which takes in a simple arithmetic operator as a first parameter
(to keep things simple let it only be ‘+’, ‘-’ or ‘*’) and an arbitrary number of arguments (only numbers) as the
second parameter. Then return the sum or product of all the numbers in the arbitrary parameter. For example:

the call make_operation(‘+’, 7, 7, 2) should return 16
the call make_operation(‘-’, 5, 5, -10, -20) should return 30
the call make_operation(‘*’, 7, 6) should return 42
